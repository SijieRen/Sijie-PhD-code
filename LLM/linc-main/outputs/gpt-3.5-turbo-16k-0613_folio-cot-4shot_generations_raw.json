Therefore, we cannot determine whether Luke is neither a twin nor triplet nor complains often about annoying siblings. The statement is uncertain.\nANSWER: Uncertain", "Let's think step by step. We want to evaluate if Luke is neither a twin nor triplet nor complains often about annoying siblings. From the premises, we know that if people have siblings who are the same age, then they are twins or triplets. Therefore, if Luke is neither a twin nor triplet, it means he does not have siblings who are the same age. From the premises, we also know that if people do not live at home regularly, then they do not develop strong bonds with their family members. And if people spend a lot of time hanging out with and playing with their siblings, then they often did not live at home regularly. Since Luke neither is a twin or triplet nor develops strong bonds with his family members, it follows that Luke does not spend a lot of time hanging out with and playing with his siblings. Finally, from the premises, we know that if people complain often about annoying siblings, then they have siblings who are the same age. Since we established that Luke does not have siblings who are the same age, it follows that Luke does not complain often about annoying siblings. Therefore, the conclusion is true.\nANSWER: True", "Let's think step by step. We want to evaluate if Luke is neither a twin nor triplet nor complains often about annoying siblings. From the premises, we know that if people have siblings who are the same age, then they are twins or triplets.

However, this doesn't tell us anything about whether Luke is a twin or triplet. We also know that if people have siblings who are the same age, they are twins or triplets. But again, this doesn't provide any information about Luke's situation. Lastly, we know that if people complain often about annoying siblings, they have siblings who are the same age. However, the premises don't give us any information about whether Luke complains often about annoying siblings.

From premise 2 and 3, we know that if people have siblings who are the same age, they are twins or triplets, and if people complain often about annoying siblings, they have siblings who are the same age.

However, the premises don't tell us anything about whether Luke lives at home regularly or if he spends a lot of time hanging out with and playing with his siblings. From premise 6, we know that Luke is either both a twin or triplet and develops strong bonds with his family members or he neither is a twin or triplet nor develops strong bonds with his family members. However, since we don't have any information about whether Luke is a twin or triplet or if he develops strong bonds with his family members, we can't determine if Luke is neither a twin nor triplet nor complains often about annoying siblings.
