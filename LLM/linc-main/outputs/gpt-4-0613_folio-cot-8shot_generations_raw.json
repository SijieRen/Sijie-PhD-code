This statement is logically inconsistent, as it contradicts itself: it says that if KO is a growth company\u2019s stock or if its price is volatile, then it can't be a company\u2019s stock or have a volatile price. We know that KO is a mature company\u2019s stock and that mature companies\u2019 stocks are suitable for a retirement fund, which means they are not volatile.

Hence, the first part of the statement is false since KO is not a growth company\u2019s stock and its price is not volatile. On the other hand, since KO is a mature company\u2019s stock, it is indeed a company's stock and its price is not volatile. Therefore, the second part of the statement is true.

We know that if KO is a growth company's stock, it is volatile, and it is not suitable for a retirement fund. However, KO is a mature company's stock, and therefore, it is suitable for a retirement fund. So it cannot be a growth company's stock. Therefore, if KO is a growth company's stock or if its price is volatile, it cannot be the case that KO is neither a company\u2019s stock nor is its price volatile because KO is a company's stock and its price is not volatile.

Harry is a gentleman, and from premise 4, we know all gentlemen are handsome. If Harry is handsome, then according to premise 2, he cannot be ugly. Therefore, he cannot be both evil and ugly. Furthermore, if Harry is neither evil nor ugly, he can be kind because the first premise states that a man is either kind or evil.

And since all gentlemen are handsome and no ugly person is handsome, Harry cannot be ugly, hence, he cannot be evil either. This means the first part of the statement, \"Harry is either both evil and ugly, or neither evil nor ugly\", is true because Harry is neither evil nor ugly. Now, because Harry is a gentleman and all CEOs are gentlemen, it can be inferred that Harry could be a CEO.

But from premise 6, we know Harry is a gentleman, so this possibility can't be true.\n\nIf Harry is neither evil nor ugly, then he could be a gentleman as being a gentleman only requires being handsome and not being ugly.

According to premise 5, if Bonnie is a young child or teenager who wishes to further her academic career and educational opportunities, then she is a student who attends the school. If she is not, she is not a student who attends the school, which means she is an inactive and disinterested member of her community according to premise 2.

The first part of the conclusion states that if Bonnie is either a young child or teenager who wishes to further her academic career and educational opportunities and chaperones high school dances, or she is neither a young child nor teenager who wishes to further her academic career and educational opportunities.

Therefore, if colorectal cancer is Cholangiocarcinoma, then the conclusion is true. \n\nIf colorectal cancer is not Cholangiocarcinoma, the conclusion states that colorectal cancer is a bile duct cancer or Cholangiocarcinoma, which is a contradiction because we assumed that colorectal cancer is not Cholangiocarcinoma. Therefore, the conclusion doesn't necessarily follow from the premises. Hence, the conclusion is uncertain.\n\nANSWER:\tUncertain\n", "Let's think step by step. We want to evaluate the statement \"If colorectal cancer is not a mild flu and a Cholangiocarcinoma, then colorectal cancer is a bile duct cancer or a Cholangiocarcinoma.\" From the premises, we know that all Cholangiocarcinoma is bile duct cancer and that bile duct cancer is a severe cancer, which is a deadly disease.

We want to evaluate the statement \"If colorectal cancer is not a mild flu and a Cholangiocarcinoma, then colorectal cancer is a bile duct cancer or a Cholangiocarcinoma.\" From the premises, we know that all Cholangiocarcinoma is bile duct cancer, and bile duct cancer is a severe cancer. So, if colorectal cancer is a Cholangiocarcinoma, then it must be a bile duct cancer. This means that if colorectal cancer is not a mild flu and a Cholangiocarcinoma, then it is definitely a bile duct cancer, as it can't be a Cholangiocarcinoma (since we assumed it's not). Therefore, the statement is true. \nANSWER:\tTrue\n", "Let's think step by step. We want to evaluate the statement \"If colorectal cancer is not a mild flu and a Cholangiocarcinoma, then colorectal cancer is a bile duct cancer or a Cholangiocarcinoma.\" From premise 4, we know that all Cholangiocarcinoma is bile duct cancer. Therefore, if colorectal cancer is a Cholangiocarcinoma, then it is also a bile duct cancer.

Firstly, we know that all Cholangiocarcinoma is bile duct cancer and all bile duct cancer are severe cancers, which are deadly diseases with low survival rate. If colorectal cancer is a Cholangiocarcinoma, then it is a bile duct cancer with low survival rate. But if colorectal cancer has low survival rate, it contradicts with the premise 6, which states that if colorectal cancer is a bile duct cancer and the survival rate is low, then colorectal cancer is not a bile duct cancer. On the other hand, if colorectal cancer is not a mild flu, it does not imply that it is a bile duct cancer or a Cholangiocarcinoma based on given premises.

Therefore, if colorectal cancer is a Cholangiocarcinoma, then colorectal cancer is a bile duct cancer. On the other hand, if colorectal cancer is not a mild flu, it doesn't tell us anything about whether it is a bile duct cancer or a Cholangiocarcinoma.

We want to evaluate if \"If colorectal cancer is not a mild flu and a Cholangiocarcinoma, then colorectal cancer is a bile duct cancer or a Cholangiocarcinoma.\" Based on the premises, colorectal cancer being a Cholangiocarcinoma and a bile duct cancer are mutually exclusive due to premise 6, meaning it cannot be both at the same time. So, if colorectal cancer is not a mild flu and a Cholangiocarcinoma, it could still be a Cholangiocarcinoma or a bile duct cancer, but not both.

We want to evaluate the statement \"If Yuri does not wear large shoes, then Yuri is an American basketball player.\" From the last premise, we know that Yuri does not wear large-sized clothes. This implies from premise 4 that Yuri does not wear large shoes. However, this doesn't tell us anything about whether Yuri is an American basketball player or not. Therefore, the conclusion does not follow from the premises. Hence, the statement is false.\nANSWER:\tFalse\n", "Let's think step by step. We want to evaluate if the statement \"If Yuri does not wear large shoes, then Yuri is an American basketball player\" is true. Given that Yuri does not wear large-sized clothes, we can infer that Yuri does not wear large shoes based on premise 4. However, knowing that Yuri doesn't wear large shoes only allows us to infer that Yuri is not tall (based on premise 3), and doesn't provide us with any information about Yuri's nationality or whether Yuri is a basketball player. Therefore, we cannot conclude that if Yuri does not wear large shoes, then Yuri is an American basketball player, so the statement is false.\nANSWER:\tFalse\n", "Let's think step by step. We want to evaluate if Yuri not wearing large shoes means that he is an American basketball player. We know that Yuri does not wear large-size clothes. This implies that he does not wear large shoes, as all people who wear large shoes also wear large-sized clothes. However, we have no information that correlates Yuri's shoe size with him being a basketball player or his nationality. Therefore, we can't infer anything about Yuri being an American basketball player based on his shoe size. The statement is therefore uncertain.\nANSWER:\tUncertain\n", "Let's think step by step. We want to evaluate if \"If Yuri does not wear large shoes, then Yuri is an American basketball player.\" From the fifth premise, we know that Yuri does not wear large-size clothes. Because of this, we know that Yuri does not wear large shoes (fourth premise). However, we know nothing about whether Yuri is a basketball player, American or not. Therefore, we cannot say that Yuri is an American basketball player, and so the conclusion does not necessarily follow the premises. Therefore, the statement is false.\nANSWER:\tFalse\n", "Let's think step by step. We want to evaluate the statement \"If Yuri does not wear large shoes, then Yuri is an American basketball player\". From premise 5, we know that Yuri does not wear large-sized clothes. From premise 4, this implies that Yuri does not wear large shoes. However, none of the premises tell us anything about Yuri's basketball playing status or his nationality. Therefore, we can't conclude that Yuri is an American basketball player. So, the statement is uncertain.\nANSWER: Uncertain\n", "Let's think step by step. We want to evaluate if Yuri, who does not wear large shoes, is an American basketball player. We know Yuri does not wear large-size clothes, which leads to the conclusion that Yuri does not wear large shoes. But this alone does not assure that Yuri is a basketball player or an American. From the premises, there is no information linking shoe size or clothing size directly to being an American basketball player. Therefore, we don't have enough information to assert that Yuri is an American basketball player. So, the statement is uncertain.\nANSWER:\tUncertain\n", "Let's think step by step. We want to evaluate the statement \"If Yuri does not wear large shoes, then Yuri is an American basketball player\". From the premises, we know that if someone is tall, they wear large shoes and if someone wears large shoes, they wear large-sized clothes. Since Yuri does not wear large-sized clothes, it means Yuri does not wear large shoes. If Yuri does not wear large shoes, then Yuri is not tall, therefore, Yuri is not a basketball player at all. As a result, Yuri cannot be an American basketball player. Therefore, the statement is false.\nANSWER:\tFalse\n", "Let's think step by step. We want to evaluate if Yuri not wearing large shoes means Yuri is an American basketball player. From the fourth premise, we know if someone does not wear large shoes, they do not wear large-sized clothes. Yuri does not wear large-sized clothes. However, this does not provide any information about Yuri's nationality or whether he is a basketball player. Therefore, the conclusion does not follow from the premises, so the statement is false.\nANSWER:\tFalse\n", "Let's think step by step. We want to evaluate if Yuri not wearing large shoes implies that Yuri is an American basketball player. From the last premise, we know that Yuri does not wear large-size clothes. This means Yuri does not wear large shoes, because if they did, they would also wear large-sized clothes. However, this doesn't tell us anything about whether Yuri is an American basketball player. Nothing in the premises links shoe size or clothes size to being an American basketball player. Therefore, the statement is uncertain.\nANSWER:\tUncertain\n", "Let's think step by step. We want to evaluate the statement \"if Yuri does not wear large shoes, then Yuri is an American basketball player\". From the last premise, we know that Yuri does not wear large-size clothes. If someone wears large shoes, they wear large-sized clothes. Therefore, Yuri does not wear large shoes. Let's assume Yuri does not wear large shoes. This doesn't tell us anything about whether Yuri is an American basketball player, so the statement isn't true, meaning it is either False or Uncertain. To distinguish between the two, notice that we could have a scenario where Yuri is not an American basketball player and still does not wear large shoes. None of the premises are violated in this case. This means the statement must be false.\nANSWER:\tFalse\n"], ["Let's think step by step.
